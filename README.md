STRING KERNEL SOFTWARE
==========================
This package contains the C++ implementation of a string kernel that allows to compare discrete data sequences of a different length, such as sentences, DNA sequences, temporal data streams. A computed kernel can be directly used with the LibSVM library and also saved to a file in the LibSVM kernel format (LibSVM library: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm).

The package was developed by Marianna Madry (marianna.madry@gmail.com) at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Sweden. It is released under the BSD license.

--------------------------
The code is based on the following publication:
H. Lodhi, C. Saunders, J. Shawe-Taylor, N. Cristianini, and C.Watkins. Text Classification using String Kernels. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2:419-444, 2002.
